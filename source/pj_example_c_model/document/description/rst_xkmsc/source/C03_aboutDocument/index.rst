About Document
==============

   Directory *document* contains **five** different kinds of documents.

*  :doxygen:     source-file-related documents, which are generated by Doxygen.
*  :description: module-related documents,      which are written manually.
*  :brief:       branch-related documents,      which are written manually.
*  :conclusion:  phase-related documents,       which are written manually.
*  :performance: evaluation-related documents,  which are generated by regression environments.


Doxygen
-------

   Directory *doxygen* contains source-file-related documents, which are generated by Doxygen:

      |  "Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources,
      |  but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C ..."

   Please refer to https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html for more information.


Description
-----------

   Directory *description* contains module-related documents, which may contain contents like

*  introduction and background
*  algorithm and workflow
*  functions & their call relationship (sure, we can refer to Doxygen documents for more detailed information)
*  macro definitions, types, and classes & their members (sure, we can refer to Doxygen documents for more detailed information)
*  performance and comparison
*  TODOs


Brief
-----

   Directory *brief* contains branch-related documents, which may contain contents like

*  introduction and background
*  motivation and target
*  algorithm and workflow
*  delta of commits
*  performance and comparison
*  TODOs


Conclusion
----------

   Directory *conclusion* contains phase-related documents, which may contain contents like

*  target and date
*  updates in each directory
*  status of each branch
*  achievements and insufficiency
*  TODOs


Performance
-----------

   Directory *performance* contains evaluation-related documents, which may contain contents like

*  run time
*  accuracy, SNR, PSNR

.. do not delete this backslash, otherwise, format of the above list will be strange

\

   And those contents should be easily produced and reproduced by regression environments.


Existing Environments
---------------------

doxygen/xkmsc

*  Usage

      |  In the environment, change directory to *document/doxygen/xkmsc*,
      |  then you can

   #. try the above functions with

      ::

         ./doxygen.sh

      then you will get
