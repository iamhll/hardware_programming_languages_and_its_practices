About Document
==============

   Directory *document* contains **four** different kinds of documents.

*  :description: module-related documents,      which are written manually
*  :brief:       branch-related documents,      which are written manually
*  :conclusion:  phase-related documents,       which are written manually
*  :performance: evaluation-related documents,  which are generated by simulation, check, and synthesis environments


Description
-----------

   Directory *description* contains module-related documents, which may contain contents like

*  introduction and background
*  structure and workflow
*  module & their call hierarchy
*  macro definitions, parameters, and key variables
*  performance and comparison
*  TODOs


Brief
-----

   Directory *brief* contains branch-related documents, which may contain contents like

*  introduction and background
*  motivation and target
*  structure and workflow
*  delta of commits
*  performance and comparison
*  TODOs


Conclusion
----------

   Directory *conclusion* contains phase-related documents, which may contain contents like

*  target and date
*  updates in each directory
*  status of each branch
*  achievements and insufficiency
*  TODOs

.. do not delete this backslash, otherwise, the formats of the above list will be strange

\

   (by the word "phase" here, I refer to "any stage in a series of events or in a process of development",
   for example, phase draft, phase 000 (function accomplished), phase 001 (performance optimized) or phase 002 (run time optimized))


Performance
-----------

   Directory *performance* contains evaluation related documents, which may contain contents like

*  frequency, throughput, area, power
*  accuracy, SNR, PSNR

.. do not delete this backslash, otherwise, the formats of the above list will be strange

   And those contents should be easily produced and reproduced by simulation, check, and synthesis environments.
